# Page Review Notes

## Hero Section ✅
- Asymmetric layout looks great
- Typography hierarchy is clear
- Generated hero image is stunning
- Gold accent line and scroll indicator work well

## Story Section ✅
- Lifestyle image is warm and on-brand
- Drop-cap F looks elegant
- Stats row is clean
- Decorative frame on image adds depth

## Products Section - Needs Attention
- The Unsplash product images don't match the brand aesthetic well
- The serum image shows a generic white bottle, the moisturizer shows a random product
- The toner image shows dark blue bottles (off-brand)
- The eye cream image shows random cosmetics (lipstick, etc.)
- SOLUTION: Replace with better Unsplash images that match warm, minimal, luxury skincare aesthetic

## Still need to check:
- Ingredients section
- Bundles section
- Testimonials section
- Footer
