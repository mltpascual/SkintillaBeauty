# Skintilla Beauty — Product Guidelines

## Brand Voice and Tone

Skintilla Beauty communicates with a voice that is **warm, knowledgeable, and aspirational** without being pretentious. The tone balances scientific credibility with sensory indulgence — every piece of copy should feel like a trusted friend who also happens to be a skincare expert.

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Warm** | Inviting and personal, never clinical | "Your skin deserves this moment of luxury" |
| **Knowledgeable** | Ingredient-informed, evidence-based | "Bakuchiol, a plant-based retinol alternative, gently resurfaces…" |
| **Aspirational** | Elevating daily routines into rituals | "Transform your evening cleanse into a botanical ritual" |
| **Transparent** | Honest about ingredients and processes | "We source our rosehip oil from organic farms in Chile" |

### Tone Modulation

The tone shifts subtly depending on context. Product descriptions lean more poetic and sensory, emphasizing texture, scent, and the experience of application. Ingredient explanations adopt a more educational register, building trust through clarity. Promotional copy maintains warmth while introducing urgency through seasonal or limited-edition framing rather than aggressive discount language.

## Terminology and Glossary

| Term | Usage | Avoid |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Ritual** | Preferred over "routine" in marketing copy | "Regimen," "protocol" |
| **Botanical** | Describes plant-derived ingredients | "Chemical-free" (inaccurate) |
| **Pampering** | Core brand promise | "Treatment" (too clinical) |
| **Glow** | Describes desired skin outcome | "Anti-aging" (negative framing) |
| **Nourish** | Describes product action | "Fix," "correct" |
| **Curated** | Describes bundles and collections | "Bundled," "packaged" |
| **Artisanal** | Describes formulation process | "Mass-produced," "manufactured" |

## Error Message Conventions

Error messages maintain the brand voice even in failure states. They should be empathetic, solution-oriented, and never blame the user.

| Scenario | Message Style |
|----------|---------------|
| Form validation | "We'd love to help — could you double-check your email address?" |
| Out of stock | "This favorite is taking a moment to restock. We'll let you know when it returns." |
| Network error | "Something went awry on our end. Please refresh and try again." |
| 404 page | "This page seems to have wandered off. Let's get you back to beautiful skin." |

## User-Facing Copy Standards

All product names use title case and follow the pattern: **[Adjective] + [Ingredient/Benefit] + [Product Type]**. Examples include "Golden Glow Serum," "Velvet Rose Cleanser," and "Eye Revival Cream." Prices are displayed with the dollar sign prefix and two decimal places (e.g., $48.00). Ingredient lists use common names first with INCI names in parentheses where relevant.

Calls to action use active, inviting language: "Explore the Collection," "Discover Your Routine," "Begin Your Glow Journey." Avoid aggressive sales language such as "Buy Now," "Limited Time Only," or "Don't Miss Out."

## Documentation Style

Technical documentation follows a clear, structured format with descriptive headings. Code comments explain the "why" rather than the "what." Component documentation includes props tables, usage examples, and accessibility notes. README sections use progressive disclosure — essential information first, detailed configuration later.

## Color and Visual Language in Copy

When describing products in copy, reference the botanical palette: "cream," "olive," "gold," "espresso." Avoid generic color terms. Seasonal campaigns draw from the same earthy palette with subtle shifts — spring introduces "blossom" and "dew," autumn brings "amber" and "harvest."
