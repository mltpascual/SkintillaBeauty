# Skintilla Beauty — Product Context

## One-Line Description

Skintilla Beauty is a luxury skincare brand landing page and e-commerce experience that showcases pampering, natural-ingredient products through an editorial "Botanical Atelier" design aesthetic.

## Problem Statement

Premium skincare consumers seek brands that communicate authenticity, ingredient transparency, and luxury through their digital presence. Most skincare brand websites rely on generic templates that fail to convey the sensory, botanical nature of their products. Skintilla Beauty needed a digital storefront that mirrors the tactile luxury of its physical products — one that educates, engages, and converts visitors into loyal customers.

## Solution Approach

A single-page React application designed as an immersive editorial experience rather than a conventional e-commerce catalog. The site uses asymmetric layouts, parallax scrolling, AI-generated botanical imagery, and interactive features (skincare quiz, routine builder, product comparison) to create a "Botanical Atelier" atmosphere that communicates the brand's natural luxury positioning.

## Target User Personas
